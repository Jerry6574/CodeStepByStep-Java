Write the output produced by the following method when passed each of the following arrays:

public void arrayMysteryExam6(int[] a) {
    for (int i = 1; i < a.length - 1; i++) {
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i + 1];
        if (a[i] % 2 == 0) {
            a[i] = a[i] / 2;
        }
    }
    println(Arrays.toString(a));
}

{1, 3, 4, 6}				{1, 5, 11, 6}
{8, 13, 0, 6, 11, 2}		{8, 4, 5, 8, 5, 2}
