Solution to: https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/java/arrays/arrayMystery3

public void mystery3(int[] nums) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
            nums[i + 1]++;
        }
    }
}
For each array below, indicate what the array's contents would be after the method mystery were called and passed that array as its parameter.

{42}	
{14, 7}	
{7, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4}	
{10, 8, 9, 5, 5}	
{12, 11, 10, 10, 8, 7}
