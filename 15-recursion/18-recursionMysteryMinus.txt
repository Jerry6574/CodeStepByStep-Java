For each call to the following recursive method, write the value that would be returned.

public int recursionMysteryMinus(int x, int y) {
    if (x < y) {
        return x;
    } else {
        return recursionMysteryMinus(x - y, y);
    }
}
(Side note: What is the method really doing?)
Answer: returns x % y
