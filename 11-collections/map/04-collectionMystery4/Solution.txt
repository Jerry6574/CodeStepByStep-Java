Solution to: https://www.codestepbystep.com/problem/view/java/collections/map/collectionMystery4

Write the output that is printed when the given method below is passed 
each of the following maps and lists as its parameters. 
Recall that maps print in a {key1=value1, key2=value2, ..., keyN=valueN} format.

Though hash maps usually have unpredictable ordering, for this problem, 
you should assume that when looping over the map or printing a map, 
it visits the keys in the order that they were added to the map or the 
order they are declared below. If a map calls put() on a key that already exists, 
it replaces that key and keeps it in its current position in the ordering.

public void collectionMystery4(HashMap<String, String> map, ArrayList<String> list) {
    HashMap<String, String> result = new HashMap<String, String>();
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
        String s = list.get(i);
        if (result.containsKey(s)) {
            result.put(s, result.get(s) + result.get(s));
        } else if (map.containsKey(s)) {
            result.put(map.get(s), s);
        }
    }
    println(result);
}

map = {Marty=Stepp, Cynthia=Lee, Keith=Schwarz, Bruce=Lee, Mehran=Sahami};
list = [Cynthia, Bruce, Lee, Eric, Schwarz, Keith, Sahami]	
Answer: {Lee=BruceBruce, Schwarz=Keith}
